# hello-world

This is my 1st repository on github for trial. I am a Statistician, meanwhile I like programming. As we are exploring with gigantic amount of data, it is important to be able to use the appropriate tools to undertand, clean, visualize and best utilize the data for story-telling and prediction in a timely manner. Github.com is a nice place to learn and share.
